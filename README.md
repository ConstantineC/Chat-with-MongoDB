This is chat, based on Socket.io and MongoDB.
To use it you shoud do a few steps:
1. Download it from my GitHub page;
2. Install all of the dependencies (here are a lot of them, ya);
3. Install or(and) use Live Server in your code editor (I use VS Code, but believe, that your editor has same features and plugins;
4. Use chat on expected port.


That's all.
